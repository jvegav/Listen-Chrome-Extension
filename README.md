## Why Listen?

In my experience learning a new language, I often found myself unsure of how many sentences or words were pronounced. I had to constantly use Google Translate, copying and pasting each word or sentence to learn the pronunciation. This process was cumbersome and time-consuming. To make language learning easier and more efficient, I developed Listen. By turning your selected text into an audio experience, Listen is the perfect companion for anyone looking to improve their language skills or simply enjoy a hands-free reading experience.
