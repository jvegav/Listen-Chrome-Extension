## 💡 Why Listen?

As a language learner, I often struggled with pronunciation. I constantly copied and pasted text into Google Translate just to hear how it sounded — a repetitive and time-consuming process.  
That’s why I built **Listen** — to simplify pronunciation and make language learning more efficient, immersive, and hands-free. Whether you're a student, traveler, or multitasker, **Listen** helps you engage with content effortlessly.
